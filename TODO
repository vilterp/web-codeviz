BUGS

- CallViews calling render() in their onMouseIn, onMouseOut events only works cuz their superview has no translation.
  - come up with a real re-rendering queue system, like Cocoa's needsDisplayRect or whatever it is

TODO

- should only check visible subviews...
- click events should bubble up (offsetting all the way...)

- scroller
- highlight lines on mouseover
- line cursor
- local variables
- ...
